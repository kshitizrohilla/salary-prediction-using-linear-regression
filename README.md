# Salary Prediction based on Years of Experience using Linear Regression
This notebook aims to predict salaries based on years of experience using linear regression from scratch.

To determine how well our regression line fits the data, we calculated the correlation coefficient (R) and the coefficient of determination (R2).

This prediction is done from scratch without the use of external libraries such as the Scikit-learn library.
